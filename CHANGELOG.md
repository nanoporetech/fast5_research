* Add data cleaning steps for stringly types
* Unpin numpy version

v1.0.12
-------
* Enforce some typing constraints on meta data for compatibility with some basecallers.

-------
* Ignore h5py warnings on import

v1.0.10
-------
* Fix bug finding attributes when EventDetection not present

v1.0.8
------
* Easy import of core classes and functions:
